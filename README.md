# Phishing-URL-Detection-using-Neural-Network
This URL Phishing Detection Model leverages Machine Learning to identify phishing websites with high accuracy by analyzing 26 distinct features. These features include URL characteristics (such as length, suspicious keywords, and HTTPS presence), website structure elements (like domain name, how is records, ssl records, length and HTML patterns), and behavioral traits (such as login forms and redirects). The model is trained on large datasets of both legitimate and phishing websites, using advanced algorithms to detect subtle patterns associated with phishing attempts. With robust performance metrics and the ability to integrate into real-time systems, the model provides a scalable, high-accuracy solution for protecting users from online fraud and malicious attacks.
